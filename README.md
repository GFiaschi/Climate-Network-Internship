In this report, I focused on the analysis of climate networks by examining various scenarios provided by the Copernicus Climate Data Store. 
During the internship, we concentrated on computational methods and modeling techniques to manage large-scale datasets and extract key climate variables such as temperature and precipitation. 
The primary objective was to construct a correlation network between spatial patches and analyze its temporal evolution from 2020 to 2100 under different climate scenarios. 
These scenarios were based on varying levels of COâ‚‚ emissions and the degree of sustainability awareness and commitment demonstrated by political governments.
